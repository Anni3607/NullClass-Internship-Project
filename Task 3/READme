Task 3: Analysis of Data Engineer and Data Scientist Jobs

Objective: The goal of this task was to create a chart of the top 10 companies hiring for Data Engineer roles with a Data Scientist job title. 
The analysis was based on a set of specific and restrictive criteria.


Filters Applied:
* Role was filtered to Data Engineer.
* Job Title was filtered to Data Scientist.
* Countries were filtered to exclude Asian countries and any countries starting with the letter 'C'.
* Preference was set to Female only.
* Job Posting Date was filtered to be between January 1, 2023, and June 1, 2023.
* Qualification was filtered to B.Tech.
* Latitude was filtered to be below 10.
* A time-based filter was applied for 3 PM IST to 5 PM IST.

Chart Type: A bar chart was used for this analysis.

Final Result: After applying all the specified filters, the chart was blank. Repeated and concise testing, including a cross-check with the raw data,
confirmed that NO RECORDS in the dataset matched all the criteria. This indicates that no job postings that fit all the conditions were found in the provided data.

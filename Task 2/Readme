Task 2 
1. Objective
The primary objective of this task was to draw a chart to analyze job postings based on a very specific set of criteria.
The goal was to identify and visualize male mechanical engineer jobs with a salary greater than $50,000, located in Asian countries, with a work type of either full-time or part-time.
These jobs also had to be with a company size less than 50,000, have more than 5 years of experience, and have been posted on the 'idealist' job portal.
The final dashboard element was required to be visible only between 3 PM and 5 PM IST.

2. Methodology
The analysis was performed in Tableau by first connecting to the cleaned dataset, _task2_cleaned_FINAL.csv.
A bar chart was created with Company on the Rows shelf and a Count (Distinct) of Job Id on the Columns shelf to count the number of job postings per company.
A series of filters were then applied to this chart to narrow the dataset down to the specific criteria outlined in the problem statement.

3. Filters Applied
All of the following filters were applied to the data:

Company Size: The filter was set to include companies with a size less than 50,000.
Work Type: The filter was set to include Full time and Part time only.
Preference: The filter was set to include only a male preference.
Job Title: The filter was set to include only the title mechanical engineer.
Experience: The filter was set to include an experience of more than 5 years.
Clean Salary: The filter was set to include a salary of more than $50k.
Job Portal: The filter was set to include only jobs from the idealist portal.
Country: The filter was set to include jobs only from Asian countries.
Time-Based Filter: A calculated field was created to ensure the chart is visible only between 3 PM and 5 PM IST.

4. Key Finding
After applying all of the required filters, the chart showed zero job postings.
This indicates that there are no records in the provided dataset that meet all of the specific conditions outlined in the problem statement.
This is a valid and crucial finding that directly answers the analysis question and should be documented as the final result for Task 2
